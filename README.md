# bodyfly-sample

Basically a simplified example of how I think we should go about the website basically a blueprint, a wireframe is the technical term, but this is a more loosely wireframe.

The jumbotron carousel is to present selling points of bodyfly, and briefly what the company is about

Responsive navbar with dropdown feature for each exercise (responsive means that the site will adjust for screen size dimensions different screens have different sizes, which requires a different presentation for each one)

The exercises are grouped by function i.e pull, push, legs this is to help make it seem less daunting

the some current images are place holders, and the some text I'm thinking should be techniques/tips on how to perform the exercise

The navbar is fixed-top, so people don't have to scroll up to the top

There is a footer at the bottom, for the main one we should defintiely put social links for both C.A.S.S and Bodyfly
